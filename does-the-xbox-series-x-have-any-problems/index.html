Whatï¿½s All This About The Xbox Series X Running Hot From purexbox.com</p>
<p>You might be in the middle of your best playthrough when the console suddenly shuts off and you lose all. Microsoft has uploaded a blog post covering the known issues people are facing with the xbox series x/s consoles. Xbox series x has a nasty compatibility problem â what you need to know last sentence of the 5th graph: If you are having an issue with xbox live and your area is not listed, make sure to submit a report below.</p>
<h3 id="keep-your-xbox-series-x-clean">Keep your xbox series x clean.</h3><p>Xbox series x, series s known system bugs and issues. I use the elite series 2 controller. To use the âxbox home buttonâ or just the âxbox buttonâ on my controller i have to press all the way down, it sounds dumb but it wasnât like this on my other xbox controllers. Does anyone else have this issue? This is brand new hardware, of course, so, understandably, some issues are popping up that have no proper answers. It makes it kind of uncomfortable when i have to reposition my thumb to get the right angle to press down all the way.</p>
